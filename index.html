    <header><h3>Blender:</h3></header>
    <p>As mentioned above blender has a verity of tools to help you with optimal workflow.</p>
    <p>When you open the software you will be able to choose from the get go, the different workspaces you would prefer to work in, like the 2D workspace (also known as Grease Pencil) or the General workspace which is the 3D Animation interface or just Modeling and Editing.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Pros_and_Cons:">
    <header><h3>Pros and Cons:</h3></header>
        <p>There are many good things blender can do</p>
        <li>You can work on a large project and finish them in one go "that is if you machine can hendle the pressure."</li>
        <li>You will be part of a community that's always available and ready to help you with your blender experience.</li>
        <li>And lastly It's free!</li>
        <b>However there are some downside.</b>
        <p><li>Even though it is a free software, you will find that you need to buy some Add-ons for workflow to be faster unless you prefere modeling and builder your own assets, you would also have to credit the original creators of some of the models you might use from the add-ons.</li> 
        <li>You might sometimes feel the need to use some paid softwares like Adobe Premiere or After-Effect for better effects and so on...</li></p>
